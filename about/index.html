        <h1>We Exist to Eliminate Assembly Failure.</h1>
        <p class="section-intro" style="max-width: 750px; margin: 0 auto;">
          We are not a typical fastener manufacturer. We are an engineering team obsessed with the power of geometry. We believe 99% of assembly failures—jamming, vibration loosening, and unexpected breaks—originate from geometric flaws smaller than 0.1mm that are overlooked in the design stage. Our mission is to find and fix them before they become your costly reality.

                <blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc; padding-left: 20px; margin-left: 0; font-style: italic;">
                    "I've spent 10+ years in non-standard parts manufacturing. I've seen too many 'theoretically perfect' designs become disasters on the assembly line. I started Gorgeo Fasteners with one belief: a part's value is not whether it matches a drawing's dimensions, but whether it perfectly performs its function in the final assembly. We are obsessed with the ±0.01mm that makes the difference, because we know that's where reliability is born."

                    <h3>Geometry Over Guesswork</h3>
                    <p>We don't rely on trial and error. Every solution is derived from a rigorous digital analysis of your design's geometry, ensuring predictable, repeatable success on your assembly line.</p>

                    <h3>Partners in Iteration</h3>
                    <p>We see prototyping as a collaborative discovery process. Our structural prototypes are made for real-world testing, allowing us to find and fix problems together before mass production.</p>

                    <h3>The Fit-Function Guarantee</h3>
                    <p>Our promise extends beyond dimensional accuracy. We guarantee our parts will achieve their intended function within your assembly, taking responsibility for the final fit, not just the numbers.</p>

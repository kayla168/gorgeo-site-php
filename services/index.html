        <h1>Our Process: From Drawing to Guaranteed Fit</h1>
        <p>We don't just manufacture parts; we engineer reliability. This is our 3-phase process for dissecting your geometry, validating the solution, and delivering production parts that are guaranteed to fit and function. No guesswork. Just geometry.</p>

            <h3>Phase 1: Free Geometry Diagnosis</h3>
            <p>Our work begins with a digital dissection of your design. You upload a drawing, and our engineers perform a no-cost root cause analysis—investigating tolerance stack-up, coating interference, and assembly path risks that standard reviews often miss.</p>

            <h3>Phase 2: Structural Prototyping</h3>
            <p>A theory is not a solution. We machine fit-validation prototypes engineered for real-world testing. These aren't show pieces; they are structural tools used to uncover fit, force, and load anomalies before you commit to production.</p>

            <h3>Phase 3: Guaranteed Production</h3>
            <p>With geometry validated, we move to controlled production under our <em>Fit-Function Guarantee</em>. Our promise extends beyond dimensions; we guarantee function. Your parts arrive ready for a jam-free assembly line.</p>

          <details>
            <summary>What is your “Fit-Function Guarantee”?</summary>
            <p>This is our core promise. Most suppliers guarantee their parts match the dimensions on your drawing. We go a step further. We guarantee our parts will achieve the intended function in your assembly. If a part is dimensionally "correct" but still jams, vibrates loose, or fails to assemble smoothly due to an overlooked geometric factor, we consider it our failure—not yours. We’ll diagnose the root cause and re-manufacture the part correctly.</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>How do you protect my intellectual property (IP)?</summary>
            <p>We honor NDAs and confidentiality by default. Your drawings are used solely for diagnosis and production. We can sign your NDA on request.</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Do you sign NDAs or confidentiality agreements?</summary>
            <p>Yes, we regularly work under client-provided NDAs. We also have our own standard NDA template ready for immediate execution if you prefer.</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>What’s the difference between a sample and a prototype?</summary>
            <p><strong>Samples</strong> show general workmanship; our <strong>structural prototypes</strong> are custom-machined from your drawing to validate your exact geometry under real-world loads and fits.</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>How accurate are your prototypes vs. final parts?</summary>
            <p>Our prototypes are manufactured using the same precision CNC processes as production parts. Critical dimensions are held within ±0.01 mm so you can rely on them for functional testing.</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>What if my design needs to change after Phase 2?</summary>
            <p>This is a normal part of the engineering process. Our goal in Phase 2 is to find problems. If a prototype reveals a necessary design improvement, we don't see it as a setback—we see it as a success. Our team will provide engineering feedback to help you revise the geometry. We are your partners in iteration, not just a machine shop.</p>
